# Michael Uses

My software, hardware and gear - all in one place. Inspired by Wes Bos' [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/)

### Setup stuff

I maintain a [macOS setup cheat sheet](https://github.com/miclgael/setup/), [a similar one for Windows](https://github.com/miclgael/setup-win/), and [another for Linux](https://github.com/miclgael/setup-linux).

### Editor + Terminal

- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is my current editor. I made the switch to Visual Studio Code from Atom in 2018, and made the conscious choice to swap to the version with telemetry removed. Before that I used Brackets, Coda and Sublime Text. I wrote my first lines of code with Notepad++ in 2005.
- Default Dark+ theme, default vs-seti icons.
- I use iTerm2 for my terminal. I change the font to Fira Code, and font-size to 14.
- On Linux I use the default PoP!_\OS terminal.
- I use Zsh as my shell, with the [Spaceship Prompt](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt) theme, via [Fig.io](https://fig.io) (where all my dotfiles and aliases are managed now!)

### Desktop Apps

- I am a recent [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) convert, and paid for the powerpack.
- I use [Notion](http://notion.so/) for my todos, notes. I used to use [iaWriter](https://ia.net/writer). 
- I use [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/download) for backups and setups

### Design Apps

![Sketch App](https://github.com/miclgael/uses/blob/main/scribbles/uses-sketch.png)

- Designs in [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com). However, I stopped buying updates when they switched to a subscription model. For that reason, I also have Figma. 
- I manage SVG icons with [Nucleo](https://nucleoapp.com/)
- *I compress all my images* with [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac). 

### Music Apps / Gear

![Ableton live icon](https://github.com/miclgael/uses/blob/main/scribbles/uses-live10.png) 

- [Ableton Live 11](https://www.ableton.com/) is my DAW of choice these days. I used to rep Pro Tools 9 *hard* for editing and mixing. 
- [Sound Toys 5](http://soundtoys.com) sound design plugins
- [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) for more advanced audio routing
