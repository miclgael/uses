# Michael Uses

My software, hardware and gear - all in one place. Inspired by Wes Bos' [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/)

## [Setup stuff](#setup)

I maintain a [macOS setup cheat sheet](https://github.com/miclgael/setup/), [a similar one for Windows](https://github.com/miclgael/setup-win/), and [another for Linux](https://github.com/miclgael/setup-linux).

## [Editor + Terminal](#editor)

![iTerm2 icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miclgael/uses/main/scribbles/uses-iterm.png)

- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is my current editor. I made the switch to Visual Studio Code from Atom in 2018, and made the conscious choice to swap to the version with telemetry removed. Before that I used Brackets, Coda and Sublime Text. I wrote my first lines of code with Notepad++ in 2005.
- Default Dark+ theme, default vs-seti icons.
- I use iTerm2 for my terminal. I change the font to Fira Code, and font-size to 14.
- On Linux I use the default PoP!_\OS terminal.
- I use Zsh as my shell, with the [Spaceship Prompt](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt) theme, via [Fig.io](https://fig.io) (where all my dotfiles and aliases are managed now!)

## [Desktop Apps](#desktop-apps)

- I manage SVG icons with [Nucleo](https://nucleoapp.com/)
