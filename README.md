## Editor + Terminal

![iTerm2 icon](scribbles/uses-iterm.png)

- VSCodium is my current editor. I made the switch to Visual Studio Code from Atom in 2018, and made the conscious choice to swap to the version with telemetry removed. Before that I used Brackets, Coda and Sublime Text. I wrote my first lines of code with Notepad++ in 2005.
- Default theme
- I keep my VS code extensions in a separate public gist. 
- I use iTerm2 for my terminal. I change the font to Fira Code, and font-size to 14.
- I use Zsh as my shell, with the default theme.

## Desktop Apps

- I use Notion for my todos and notes. I used to iaWriter, or evernote.
- Designs in Sketch

- Ableton Live 10 is my DAW of choice these days. I used to rep Pro Tools 9 *hard* for editing and mixing. 
- Loopback for more advanced audio routing
