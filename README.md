I maintain a [macOS setup cheat sheet](https://github.com/miclgael/setup/) and similar one for Windows, [here](https://github.com/miclgael/setup-win/).

<small>Full disclosure, I'm including some affiliate links for the hardware list!</small>

## Editor + Terminal

![iTerm2 icon](scribbles/uses-iterm.png)

- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is my current editor. I made the switch to Visual Studio Code from Atom in 2018, and made the conscious choice to swap to the version with telemetry removed. Before that I used Brackets, Coda and Sublime Text. I wrote my first lines of code with Notepad++ in 2005.
- Default Dark+ theme, vs-seti icons.
- I keep my VS code extensions in a [separate public gist](https://gist.github.com/miclgael/79b65d3420f95a943eb9bf94be1399c5). 
- I use iTerm2 for my terminal. I change the font to Fira Code, and font-size to 14.
- I use Zsh as my shell, with the default theme.

## Desktop Apps

- I am a recent Alfred convert, and paid for the upgrade.
- I use Notion for my todos and notes. I used to iaWriter, or evernote.

- I use Carbon Copy Cloner for backups and setups

## Design Apps

![Sketch App](scribbles/uses-sketch.png)

- Designs in [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com)
- I manage SVG icons with [Nucleo](https://nucleoapp.com/) I use [ico-moon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select) to make icon sets.
- ImageOptim for compression.

## Music Apps / Gear

![Ableton live icon](scribbles/uses-live10.png) 

- [Ableton Live 10](https://www.ableton.com/) is my DAW of choice these days. I used to rep Pro Tools 9 *hard* for editing and mixing. 
- [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) for more advanced audio routing
