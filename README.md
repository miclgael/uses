My software, hardware and gear - all in one place. Inspired by Wes Bos' [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/)

*full disclosure, I'm including some affiliate links for the hardware list!*

### Setup stuff

I maintain a [macOS setup cheat sheet](https://github.com/miclgael/setup/) and similar one for Windows, [here](https://github.com/miclgael/setup-win/).

### Editor + Terminal

- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is my current editor. I made the switch to Visual Studio Code from Atom in 2018, and made the conscious choice to swap to the version with telemetry removed. Before that I used Brackets, Coda and Sublime Text. I wrote my first lines of code with Notepad++ in 2005.
- Default Dark+ theme, vs-seti icons.
- I keep my VS code extensions in a [separate public gist](https://gist.github.com/miclgael/79b65d3420f95a943eb9bf94be1399c5). 
- I use iTerm2 for my terminal. I change the font to Fira Code, and font-size to 14.
- I use Zsh as my shell, with the default theme.

### Desktop Apps

### Design Apps

### Music Apps / Gear

- [Ableton Live 10](https://www.ableton.com/) is my DAW of choice these days. I used to rep Pro Tools 9 *hard* for editing and mixing. 
- [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) for more advanced audio routing
- [Guitar Pro 7](https://www.guitar-pro.com) for writing sheet music and sending over to band-mates, or for general archiving.
